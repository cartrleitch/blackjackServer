# blackjackServer
set up SSH server with the given sshd_config
this runs the program as soon as user connects and disconnects them immediately
when it ends (should not let them sus about).

Todo:
Get URL instead of IP\n
Do not require passwords\n
Run on server somehow idk you can't do Linux so figure it out
